## 📚 **1337 Projects (Enjoyable & Powerful Learning)**

Throughout my journey at **1337 School**, I’ve worked on engaging and impactful projects as part of the **Common Core** curriculum. These projects have expanded my knowledge, honed my problem-solving skills, and given me valuable experience in both software development and system design. Below are **some** of the projects I’ve worked on:

- **Philosophers**  
  A multithreading project simulating the "Dining Philosophers" problem. It explores process synchronization, deadlock prevention, and resource management, requiring a solid understanding of multithreading and concurrency.

- **cub3D**  
  A 3D game engine based on raycasting, inspired by **Wolfenstein 3D**. This project covers advanced algorithms, graphics programming, and game development. It deepened my understanding of raycasting, 3D rendering, and handling user input in C.

- **mini-shell**  
  A custom shell implementation in C, involving the creation of a basic shell that can execute commands, handle piping, redirection, signals, and environment variables. This project enhanced my knowledge of system calls, process management, and input/output operations.
