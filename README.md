## 📚 **1337 Projects (Enjoyable & Powerful Learning)**

Throughout my studies at **1337 School Morocco**, I’ve worked on several engaging and impactful projects as part of the **Common Core** curriculum. These projects helped me explore new topics, refine my skills, and gain powerful experience in various areas of software development and system design. Below are **some** of the projects I’ve worked on:

- **Philosophers**  
  A multithreading project simulating the "Dining Philosophers" problem. This project focuses on process synchronization, deadlock prevention, and resource management, requiring advanced knowledge of multithreading concepts and concurrency.

- **cub3D**  
  A 3D game engine based on raycasting, inspired by **Wolfenstein 3D**. This project covers advanced algorithms, graphics programming, and game development. It was a highly complex project, involving raycasting, user input handling, and 3D rendering in C.

- **mini-shell**  
  A custom shell implementation in C, this project involved creating a basic shell that can execute commands, handle piping, redirection, and signals, and work with environment variables. This required deep knowledge of system calls, process management, and handling complex input/output operations.
